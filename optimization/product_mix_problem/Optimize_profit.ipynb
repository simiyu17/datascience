The output of machine A is moved to machine C where it is processed for 10 minutes. The second subassembly starts with RM2 processed in machine B for 15 minutes. The output is taken to machine C for 5 minutes of processing. The two subassemblies are joined with a purchased part in machine D. The result is a finished unit of P. Product Q is manufactured by a similar process.\n",
