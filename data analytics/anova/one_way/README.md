#ONE-WAY ANOVA
There is a thin line of demarcation amidst t-test and ANOVA, 
i.e. when the population means of only two groups is to be compared, 
the t-test is used, but when means of more than two groups are to be compared, ANOVA is preferred.

ANOVA assumptions include the population from which sample is drawn should be normally distributed, homogeneity of variance, 
random sampling of data, independence of observations, measurement of the dependent variable on the ratio or interval level
